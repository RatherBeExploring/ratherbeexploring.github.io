<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span> taxi between Cheddi Jagan International Airport and Georgetown, Guyana can easily be found for $50 USD.  For a fraction of the price and not much more time, there is also a regular minibus service, route 42, plying the same route.  There's not much information about this route online, so here's everything I wished I had known before landing.</p>

### Is there a bus between Georgetown Airport and the city centre?
**Yes**.  Route 42 links Timehri and Georgetown, with a stop right outside the airport.  This is a 12-seater van, not a coach or city bus.

### How much does it cost?

**$500 GYD** per seat.  If you have bags, you will pay for however many seats these bags occupy.  The government-mandated fare is $260, but this is not used in practice.

### Where is the stop?

**On the street outside of departures**.  Walk out of the arrivals hall, turn right, and you will get to departures in about 30 seconds.  Keep walking and you will see a small staircase leading to the street: minibusses stop here.

### How do I get on?

Minibusses will honk as they are arriving and drivers are always looking for passengers: just a wave will get them to stop.  Pay either as you board or when you get off, cash only and drivers do have change.  Get a window seat if you can.

### Where does the route end?

**Stabroek Market**.  From here you can catch a local minibus for $100 anywhere in Georgetown.  If you want to get off earlier, just shout or tap a coin on the metal roof to signal the driver to stop.

### What is the schedule?

**There isn't one**.  Minibusses run all day, and when I found the right place to wait one arrived in less than five minutes even on a holiday.  This is a very popular route, and drivers won't wait until their van is full before leaving during busy hours: more passengers will board on the way.

### How long does it take?

**Under an hour**, depending on traffic.  You won't believe how fast a Toyota Hiace can move.

### Is it safe?

**Relatively**.  Drivers speed, overtake, tailgate, and overall drive recklessly, and there are no seatbelts.  But, drivers also know the road extremely well and don't want to crash their van anymore than you want them to.

### What's it like?

**Loud and crowded**.  The only thing guaranteed to be in perfect condition is the stereo system—your ears may well be ringing for a bit after getting off.  Settle in and enjoy the adventure.
