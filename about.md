	<p>Hi, I'm Kyle.  On a four-month trip around the world I thought, "I'm going to forget most of what I've done and seen...I should really write this stuff down somewhere."  But then I got lazy and didn't do it.</p>
	<p>A few months after that, in early 2025, flying across the Atlantic on a SWISS A330 I wrote down my thoughts, what I would have liked to have known before booking that flight, what stood out and what was interesting or noteworthy.  That was kind of fun, so I kept doing it and here we are.
	<p>This site is where I document flights, train rides, border crossings, adventures, and miscellaneous explorations that, for one reason or another, I want to remember and share with friends, family, and digital passers-by. I enjoy writing so tend to post longer-form reviews and musings.  Hopefully something here helps you decide where you'd like to go, and how you'd like to get there.</p>
